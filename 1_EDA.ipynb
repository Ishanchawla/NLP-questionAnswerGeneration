Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production.

The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924.

The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence.

After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group.

Howard stopped in Butte in September 1910. A former member of the troupe who lived in Butte buttonholed Howard at an after-show party, asking him to compose a song about Montana and got another partygoer, the city editor for the Butte Miner newspaper, Charles C. Cohan, to help. The two men worked up a basic melody and lyrics in about a half-hour for the entertainment of party guests, then finished the song later that evening, with an arrangement worked up the following day. Upon arriving in Helena, Howard's troupe performed 12 encores of the new song to an enthusiastic audience and the governor proclaimed it the state song on the spot, though formal legislative recognition did not occur until 1945. Montana is one of only three states to have a \"state ballad\", \"Montana Melody\", chosen by the legislature in 1983.

At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.\n","Paragraph words count: 124\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Question and Answer info**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["[{'answers': [{'answer_start': 515, 'text': 'Saint Bernadette Soubirous'}], 'question': 'To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear in 1858 in Lourdes France?', 'id': '5733be284776f41900661182'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 188, 'text': 'a copper statue of Christ'}], 'question': 'What is in front of the Notre Dame Main Building?', 'id': '5733be284776f4190066117f'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 279, 'text': 'the Main Building'}], 'question': 'The Basilica of the Sacred heart at Notre Dame is beside to which structure?', 'id': '5733be284776f41900661180'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 381, 'text': 'a Marian place of prayer and reflection'}], 'question': 'What is the Grotto at Notre Dame?', 'id': '5733be284776f41900661181'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 92, 'text': 'a golden statue of the Virgin Mary'}], 'question': 'What sits on top of the Main Building at Notre Dame?', 'id': '5733be284776f4190066117e'}]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":193},"id":"XaRBwrMqARQe","executionInfo":{"elapsed":52601,"status":"ok","timestamp":1617898351302,"user":{"displayName":"Rohit Chawla","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiLwyFQK9k352I03rCJYw9ee0ncQZ6UfXicYj4Tzg=s64","userId":"15873984390867734357"},"user_tz":-330},"outputId":"89859b5d-53c2-4ffb-bafe-54c0497db93c"},"source":["data = df_split[df_split['qas_cnt'].isin([4,5])].iloc[4]\n","\n","title_name = data['title']\n","paragraph = data['context']\n","QnA = data['qas']\n","para_len = data['context_len']\n","\n","printBold('Title')\n","print(title_name)\n","printBold(\"Paragraph\")\n","print(paragraph)\n","print(\"Paragraph words count:\", para_len)\n","printBold(\"Question and Answer info\")\n","print(QnA)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Title**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["University_of_Notre_Dame\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Paragraph**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["All of Notre Dame's undergraduate students are a part of one of the five undergraduate colleges at the school or are in the First Year of Studies program.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Question**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["How many student news papers are found at Notre Dame?\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Question Sentence**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Answer**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["three\n","Starts at: 126\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SnwK3RscK0Cx"},"source":["The question is actually formed from the previous sentence."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"background_save":true},"id":"FbCxt_eVJcDA","outputId":"7434d21a-fd59-45d6-d002-e3e687706a8f"},"source":["showQuestion(269)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Title**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Beyoncé\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Paragraph**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter (/biːˈjɒnseɪ/ bee-YON-say) (born September 4, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer and actress.

There are several theatres and theatre companies. The 1941 main city theatre was built by Dudok. Besides theatres there is a large number of cinemas including three arthouse cinemas. Utrecht is host to the international Early Music Festival (Festival Oude Muziek, for music before 1800) and the Netherlands Film Festival. The city has an important classical music hall Vredenburg (1979 by Herman Hertzberger). Its acoustics are considered among the best of the 20th-century original music halls.[citation needed] The original Vredenburg music hall has been redeveloped as part of the larger station area redevelopment plan and in 2014 has gained additional halls that allowed its merger with the rock club Tivoli and the SJU jazzpodium. There are several other venues for music throughout the city. Young musicians are educated in the conservatory, a department of the Utrecht School of the Arts. There is a specialised museum of automatically playing musical instruments.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Question**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Cultural life in Utrecht is second to \n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Question Sentence**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Utrecht city has an active cultural life, and in the Netherlands is second only to Amsterdam.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Answer**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Utrecht city has an active cultural life, and in the Netherlands is second only to Amsterdam\n","Starts at: 0\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SRO_YKuiM-ly"},"source":["The question words all appear in the sentence, but not in order.

An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Question**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["A reversible process is one in which this does not happen.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Question Sentence**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/markdown":"**Answer**","text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"output_type":"stream","text":["dissipation\n","Starts at: 406\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VcnqDhwhNZQS"},"source":["This is, basically, just the example of question we expect to generate.
